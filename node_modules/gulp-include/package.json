  "readme": "#gulp-include [![NPM version][npm-image]][npm-url] ![Travis build][travis-image]\n>Makes inclusion of files a breeze.  \nEnables functionality similar to that of snockets / sprockets or other file insertion compilation tools.\n\n> Made for gulp 3\n\n\n## Usage\nFirst, install `gulp-include` as a dev dependency:\n`npm install --save-dev gulp-include`\n\nThen, add your _include-comments_ to your file.  \n_People who have experience with `sprockets` or `snockets` will feel at home._\n\n\nAn _include-comment_ looks like this:\n```javascript\n//= include relative/path/to/file.js\n```\nor if you want to get crazy, a glob pattern like so:\n```javascript\n//= include relative/path/to/directory/*.js\n```\n\nor to get even crazier, an array glob similar to commonly used in GruntJS:\n```javascript\n//= include ['app/someFramework.js', 'app/**/*.js', '!app/vendor/**/*', 'app/someLibrary.js']\n```\n\n(Note: for those of you unfamiliar with the above syntax, check out https://github.com/isaacs/node-glob\nor http://gruntjs.com/configuring-tasks#globbing-patterns)\n\nYou can do all of this in any language, the only requirement is that the first character\n on the line after any #, /, or white space characters is an equal sign.\n```coffeescript\n#= require_tree relative/path/to/directory\n```\n`gulp-include` disregards whitespace, as long as the comment-line starts with a _newline_ followed `=` and contains `include`, `require` or `include_tree`, `require_tree`.\n\nThis plugin recursively expand files it includes, so you can nest includes inside of files that\n    were themselves included. IE:\n\n`main.js`:\n```\n//= include included_file.js\n```\n\n`included_file.js`:\n```\n//= include recursive_include.js\n```\nAnd so on recursively to an arbitrary depth.\n\nThe example below compiles a several coffee-files and js-files into a single js-file:\n\n`app.coffee`:\n\n```coffeescript\n`\n//= require vendor/jquery.js\n//= require vendor/modernizr.js\n`\n\n#= require controllers/AppController.coffee\n#= require_tree views\n\nclass Main extends AppController\n\tconstructor: ->\n\t\tconsole.log \"This is main!\"\n\nwindow.main = new Main()\n```\n*Note:* The example above uses backticks (\\`) to allow `gulp-coffee` to compile inline javascript\n\n`gulpfile.js`:\n\n```javascript\nvar gulp\t\t= require('gulp'),\n\tinclude\t\t= require('gulp-include'),\n\tcoffee\t\t= require('gulp-coffee');\n\ngulp.task(\"scripts\", function() {\n\tgulp.src('src/js/app.coffee')\n\t\t.pipe( include() )\n\t\t.pipe( coffee() )\n\t\t.pipe( gulp.dest(\"dist/js\") )\n});\n\ngulp.task(\"default\", \"scripts\");\n```\n\n## Options\n* `extensions` (optional)\n\t* Takes a `String` or an `Array` of extensions, eg: `\"js\"` or `[\"js\", \"coffee\"]`\n\t* If set, all inclusions that does not match the extension(s) will be ignored\n\n## Release log\n#### 1.1.1\n* Merged community fix by [trolev](https://github.com/trolev)\n\n#### 1.1.0\n* Merged feature: Keep leading whitespaces by [maxgalbu](https://github.com/maxgalbu)\n\n#### 1.0.1\n* Fixed issue which caused extensions to be \"remembered\" if `gulp-include` ran multiple times in a row, resulting in lost includes\n\n#### 1.0.0\n* Merged major refactoring by [scottmas](https://github.com/scottmas) - Many thanks!\n\t* Rewritten core (regex, replacing and file mashing)\n\t* Glob support\n\t* Recursive support\n\t* Respecting indentation of included files\n\n* Upping version to 1.0.0 - seems fitting after such a large refactor\n\n#### 0.2.3\n* Merged community fixes by [platdesign](https://github.com/platdesign) and [cujojp](https://github.com/cujojp)\n\n#### 0.2.2\n* Updated regex directive to not collide with other requireing plugins, like browserify ([cwacek](https://github.com/cwacek))\n\n#### 0.2.1\n* Changed replace-method to fix issue when requiring a file that contained special characters ([juanghurtado](https://github.com/juanghurtado))\n\n#### 0.2.0\n* Added `require_tree`/`include_tree` (Thanks to [juanghurtado](https://github.com/juanghurtado)!)\n* Method now takes an `extensions` param for controlling what types of files to include\n\n#### 0.1.0\n* Basic include\n\n## Licence\n(MIT License)\n\nCopyright (c) 2014 Hugo Wiledal\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
